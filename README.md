# AgentScore — Listing Register

A hosted tool to scrape active and sold property listings (address, price,
agent, dates) from real estate agency websites, starting with Ray White's
Dynamics-platform offices.

## How it works

Paste a list of office website addresses, click "Scrape listings". The
tool fetches each office's `/properties/for-sale` and
`/properties/sold?dateFilter=all` pages with a plain HTTP request (no
browser needed) and parses the `window.INITIAL_STATE` JSON that's already
server-rendered into the page. Results show in a table and can be
downloaded as CSV or Excel.

## What's confirmed working (tested live, June 2026)

- **Ray White Mermaid Waters** (`raywhitemermaidwaters.com.au`) — verified:
  18 active listings, full agent/price/date detail. Sold listings now
  default to the site's own ~12-month window (previously forced open to
  full history via `?dateFilter=all`, which has been removed — see
  "12-month window" below).
- **Ray White Surfers Paradise** (`raywhitesurfersparadise.com.au`) —
  verified: same `INITIAL_STATE` structure present, same URL pattern.
- **Harcourts Property Hub** (`propertyhub.harcourts.com.au`) — different
  platform (Cloudhi/Rex Software). Address, price, office, agent name,
  date_listed, sold_date, and days_on_market all confirmed working
  against live data after three rounds of bug fixes (each one caught by
  comparing assumed structure against real raw HTML, not guessing):
    1. First attempt parsed listing cards off the index page — matched
       zero real listings (wrong page shape assumed).
    2. Rebuilt against confirmed detail-page tags — but the price and
       office-name regexes matched the wrong things on real pages (an
       unrelated `<h3>` repeating the address, and a font preload link
       containing the word "Harcourts").
    3. Fixed by using two confirmed dedicated CSS classes
       (`agent-name`, `agent-office`) and a bare-`<h3>`-with-no-class
       match for price, all verified against real raw HTTP responses.

## Days on market

Calculated client-side (in `calculate_days_on_market()`) from
`date_listed` to `sold_date` for sold listings, or to today's date for
still-active listings (i.e. "days on market so far"). Works for both
adapters once their respective date fields are populated:
  - **Ray White**: `date_listed` from `creationTime`, `sold_date` from
    `soldDate` — both already present in the structured JSON data.
  - **Harcourts/Cloudhi**: `date_listed` parsed from "Added {date}" text
    near the Property ID; `sold_date` parsed from a dedicated "Sold
    Date" section (sold listings only). Both confirmed via raw HTML
    inspection of real listing pages.

**⚠️ OPEN QUESTION — Harcourts "Added" date semantics not fully verified.**
In a live scrape (June 2026), every active Harcourts/Cloudhi listing
showed an "Added" date within the last few days of the scrape date,
which is not plausible as the true original listing date for an
established office's full active inventory. The regex itself is
confirmed correctly matching real "Added {date}" text on the page (not
a different field) — but it's unverified whether this field represents
the **original listing date** or a **last-refreshed/reindexed
timestamp** that Cloudhi updates periodically regardless of when the
property actually went on the market. Until this is confirmed (e.g. by
checking a listing known to have been on the market for months and
seeing whether its "Added" date reflects that), **treat Harcourts'
date_listed and days_on_market fields as unverified** — they may
understate true time on market significantly. Ray White's dates are
not affected by this question (confirmed reliable, structured data).

## 12-month window

- **Ray White**: now respects the site's own default ~12-month window
  for sold listings, rather than forcing `?dateFilter=all` to pull full
  multi-year history. This both matches the "last 12 months is enough"
  requirement and reduces request volume.
- **Harcourts/Cloudhi**: no client-side or server-side 12-month filter
  applied yet — every listing found on page 1 of the index is included
  regardless of date. Since pagination isn't implemented either, real
  exposure to old listings is naturally limited for now, but this
  should be revisited once pagination is added.

This strongly suggests Ray White coverage works across **any Ray White
office** running Dynamics, since the structure is a property of the
platform. Cloudhi/Harcourts coverage is real but lower-confidence and
file-page-1-only until extended.

## What's NOT yet confirmed

- **LJ Hooker, Century 21, First National** — unknown which platform
  each runs on. Could be Cloudhi (in which case `CloudhiRexAdapter` may
  already work, untested) or something else entirely. Each needs the
  same detect-first treatment before trusting results.
- **Independent agencies** — likely a long tail of different CMSs.
  Not supported at all yet.
- **Agent registration/licence number** — confirmed NOT present in
  either Ray White's or Harcourts/Cloudhi's listing data. Would require
  a separate lookup against the relevant state's real estate licensee
  register (e.g. QLD Office of Fair Trading), matched by agent name.

## Known data quirks (confirmed via live testing)

- **Ray White**: `listingState` and `status`/`statusCode` can disagree
  on the same record. **Always trust `status`/`statusCode`**.
- **Ray White**: `price` is the reliable numeric guide price even when
  `displayPrice` shows non-numeric text like "AUCTION" or "CONTACT AGENT".
- **Ray White**: a small share of sold listings (~12% in the Mermaid
  Waters sample) have no `soldPrice` recorded at all, spread across
  multiple agents and years — appears genuinely missing in Ray White's
  own data, not a scraping error. Exclude these rows from any
  variance/accuracy scoring rather than treating as zero.
- **Harcourts/Cloudhi**: price is free text ("Offers Over $X", "AUCTION",
  "Contact Agent", "Expressions of Interest", etc.) — many listings will
  have no parseable numeric price by design, same pattern the original
  Domain.com.au scraper had to handle.
- **Harcourts/Cloudhi sold listings frequently have NO guide price at
  all** — confirmed via live page inspection (June 2026): many properties
  carry an explicit disclaimer ("This property is being sold without a
  price & therefore a price guide cannot be provided") and the sold
  listing page only ever shows the final sold figure, never an original
  asking price. This is a genuine source-data limitation, not a scraping
  gap — unlike Ray White, which retains both `price` and `soldPrice` on
  every sold listing regardless of how it was marketed. **Practical
  effect**: most Harcourts agents will show real `total_sales` activity
  but few or zero `scored_sales`/variance results, since variance scoring
  requires both a guide and sold price. The Agent Rankings export's
  Summary Stats sheet reports per-adapter guide-price coverage so this
  gap is visible rather than silently producing an empty-looking ranking
  for an entire office.

## Architecture

```
api/
  app.py          Flask routes: page, /api/scrape, /api/export.csv, /api/export.xlsx
  scraper.py       Adapter-based scraping core
  templates/
    index.html     Frontend (paste URLs, view table, export)
  test_scraper.py  Tests using fake INITIAL_STATE data (no network needed)
```

`scraper.py` is built as an adapter framework on purpose, even though only
one adapter exists today (`RayWhiteDynamicsAdapter`). Each adapter
implements:

- `detect(html)` — does this site match this platform? Checked before
  any parsing is attempted, so a site that merely resembles Ray White's
  structure without actually being it won't get silently mis-parsed.
- `fetch(domain, log)` — pull and normalize listings into the shared
  `Listing`/`Agent` dataclasses.

Adding support for a new platform means writing one new adapter class and
appending it to `ADAPTERS` in `scraper.py` — the app, frontend, and export
logic don't need to change.

Every `Listing` carries `source_adapter` and `extraction_confidence`
fields, so lower-confidence extraction methods (e.g. a future generic
JSON-LD or regex fallback adapter for independents) can be filtered out
of scoring calculations downstream without losing the data entirely.

## Running locally

```bash
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
```

## Testing without real network access

```bash
cd api
python3 test_scraper.py
```

This validates the parsing/normalization logic against a fake
`INITIAL_STATE` blob shaped exactly like the real, confirmed structure —
useful for catching bugs without needing to hit live sites.

## Next steps

1. Test against a Harcourts/LJ Hooker/Century 21/First National Gold
   Coast office to find out whether the Dynamics structure is shared
   across franchises, or Ray White-specific.
2. If shared: confirm the existing adapter just works for them too.
   If different: write a second adapter following the same pattern.
3. Decide on registration-number lookup (separate licensee register
   integration) if that field is still required for the client.
4. Variance/accuracy scoring (guide vs sold price per agent) as a
   second stage once enough offices are scraped — same A/B/C grading
   model used in the original AgentScore proof of concept.
